I"“<p>Hi, all today I wanted to share with you one of the most awaited topics since I started learning elastic search. We used to have a product called <strong>MyCareer.com</strong> where we used elasticsearch and indexed around 20 million resumes. Every time due to the aggressive timelines and incremental development we are in a situation where we need to add a couple of properties to an existing index. Till now we have only one solution i.e adding new properties to the existing mapping, creating a new index based on the new mapping, and try to reindex the data by passing the source and destination index. It is a tedious job correct so thatâ€™s the reason elasticsearch came up with <strong>Data Streams</strong> and  I will cover this topic in upcoming posts. In elasticsearch 7.11 release they came with a solution called Runtime Fields. Please make note that  it is available in  <strong>Beta</strong></p>
