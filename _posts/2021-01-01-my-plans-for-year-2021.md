## Happy New Year 2021
 First of all, Thank you for all  following my blog and showing interest in reading my articles. In this blog post, I would like to discuss my plans for the year 2021. I’ll work hard to accomplish all my goals mentioned here and share my learnings.

### Here is a brief list of odo’s I am planning to accomplish in 2021

* **Increase my blogging frequency**: I started blogging since 2 years, but i was like passive participant and I used to create posts perodically due to my work. I understand the value and importance of contributing to the community. So this year I again want to get in touch with developer communities and my fellow developers. So my target for this year and upcoming years is to post at least one article( of course useful ones) per week.

* **Learn Apache Kafka in depth**:**A**pache Kafka is a community distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Initially conceived as a messaging queue, Kafka is based on an abstraction of a distributed commit log. Since being created and open sourced by LinkedIn in 2011, Kafka has quickly evolved from messaging queue to a full-fledged event streaming platform.I have hands-on experience but I need to get my hands dirty in depth on  KsqlDb, Kafka-Api, Kafka-Cluser Architecture.

* **Use at least one programming language other than the ones which I frequently use**: Since 4  years I'm  working on Microsoft technologies and NoSql databases like ELK stack, Couchbase and MongoDb, I did write code in other programming languages like “Python” and did develop a good project using these technologies. But I was like a Nightwatchman ( If you follow cricket, especially test matches) working on these technologies. Of course, I strongly believe that Programming language should never be a barrier to implement ideas or thoughts for a good developer. At any given point of time, I believe that a good developer should be capable of writing code in any programming language. But of course there is a slight difference between writing code in a new programming language and excelling in that programming language. So I decided to learn and excel in “Python”. Reason for choosing Python is for 4 years I am using C# which is statically typed and I would like to the taste the dynamic nature of python now. Also, I am planning to learn about data engineering, Python provides some packages in those areas like NumPy, SciPi and many more. Also, another reason is I would like to explore Apache Spark and using PySpark I’ll be able to write map-reduce functions.

And the list is never ending but I would like to focus on these technologies and goals for this year and If time permits, I’ll be focusing on some other topics like exploring AWS cloud solutions such as AWS Athena, Azure cloud solutions such as Application Gateways, Azure Bastion etc and Red Hat OpenShift which is an open source container application platform based on the Kubernetes container orchestraton.

Last but on the least I would like to thank my well wishers, mentors who has always been my constant support starting with my mentors Kiran Sangita, Siva AVKD, Pavan Arya, Sumath AWS, Aravind ELK and list continues.......... 

And once again I wish everyone a Happy New Year. Please do post your valuable suggestions, questions, and learnings, and let’s try to learn as much as possible this year.

Thanks,<br>
